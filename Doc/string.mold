# Three equivalent quotes to store strings:
'single quoted string'
"double quoted string"
`one more way for defining strings`

# String concatenation.
x = 'Hello'
y = 'Mold'
z = x + ' ' + y # Now z stored 'Hello Mold' text

# Access single character by index.
print x[0]

# Get string length
print len(x)

# String with inlined variable values.
x = 1
y = 2
z = 'x has ${x} value, and y is ${y}'
print z
