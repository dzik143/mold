Unreleased
------------------------------------
  Dropped syntax:
    - negative array indexes x[-1] generate runtime error

  Code generation:
    - Create map/array from static init list
    - Non-variant params,
    - Non-variant return value in ordinary calls,
    - Skip vtable entries for methods used only as ordinary calls.

  Internal maintain:
    - Better type guess

0.3.200720 (released on 2020-07-20):
------------------------------------

  Dropped syntax:
    - x[key] is not allowed for maps anymore, use x{key} instead.

  New language syntax:
    - unimplemented method foo(x,y,z) -> rv

  Implemented:
    - Build-in null variable

    - Relative array selectors:
      x[@last]        - the last item in the array            (lval, rval)
      x[@first]       - the first item in the array           (lval, rval)
      x[@afterLast]   - placeholder for new item at the end   (lval)
      x[@beforeFirst] - placeholder for new item at the begin (lval)

   - AST optimizer: remove calls to empty functions
   - X64 optimizer: stub for x[i] load with native type

  Internal maintain:
    - Core: Major clean up around error handling
    - Parser: Removed AST convert step
    - Parser: Use built-in substr internally
    - Parser: Rewritten code building AST tree
    - Translator: Better static type adjustment
    - Translator: More static errors with source line presented

0.2.200706 (released on 2020-07-06)
-----------------------------------
  Implemented:
    - RDTSC based profiler (--profiler option)

  Improved:
    - Faster x64 code (load/store indexes with int32 pointers)
    - Avoid creating multiple Parser() objects per each module load
    - Distinguish variant and string types while generating code

  New language syntax:
    - Distinguish reference by index (integer) and by key (string):
      x = [1,2,3,4]
      print x[0]

      y = {'key': 1234}
      print y{'key'}

    - Stub for relative array indexes (x[@selector]).

    - x ~ y for string concatenation, x + y is not correct anymore.

  Internal maintain:
    - Major clean up the parser code

0.1.191126 (released on 2019-11-26)
-----------------------------------

  First release with assigned version.

  Implemented:
    - Self-hosted interpreter,
    - Self-hosted X64 compiler,
    - Tests,
    - Intermediate MIR language,
    - Basic -O1 optimizations.

  Dropped functionalities:
    - No more C bootstrap, code is self-hosted,
    - no more C target, only MIR and X64 assembler are supported.

unnamed version (around 2015)
-----------------------------

  - Init bootstrap in C
  - Interpreter
  - Compiler to C target
