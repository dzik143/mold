# MOLD interpreter/compiler for x64 CPU (Amd64).

## NOTE for downloaders:
- I discovered there are people (or maybe animals too?), who pull this repo from time to time.
- This code is heavy **under construction** and is really **far from final product** (state on 2025-06-14).
- Some time ago I wanted to learn **how to write a compiler** and I'm still **learning inside this repo** after everyday work.
- All current versions are **even not beta**, but alpha.
